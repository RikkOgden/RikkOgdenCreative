      <p>My name is <strong>Rikk Ogden</strong> and I am a self-trained digital creative and website designer who is <strong>currently seeking the right team or company to be a part of</strong>. I'm also a husband and a father, a music lover, guitarist and an avid video gamer.</p>
      <p>My quest is to continue to grow as a front-end developer, having a passion for design and technology. I'm dedicated, loyal, hard-working and consider myself a problem solver.</p>
      <p>My favourite colour, despite my website's asthetic, is <span class="feature__favourite-colour">purple</span>.</p>

  <h2 class="feature__subheader">February 1998 - October 2017</h2>
    <div class="col col--sm__7 col--md__8 ">
        <p>I am a self-trained digital creative and website designer. For 19 years I worked for a UK travel company, <b>Chadwell Travel Ltd</b>. Trading as <strong>a1travel</strong> (initially trading as 'Premier Leisure'), starting out as a holiday salesman. After a few years it was clear that e-commerce was starting to take off, and we needed a web presence. Having an art and design college background, and a passion for design and technology, I propsed that the company gave me the chance to build the company website.</p>
        <p>The company kindly gave me a chance to do this, and so I bought a couple of books on HTML and began my journey to becoming a web professional and began to create what would become a successful independent travel provider website, <strong>a1travel.com.</strong> The rest, they say, is history!</p>
        <p>On my quest, I taught myself HTML, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, classic ASP and SQL.</p>
        <p>I created a database and back-end using classic ASP and MS SQL Server to provide a CMS for holiday deals which were advertised and displayed on the website. We had an integrated e-commerce solution from an industry provider. As technology moved on, the company switched to .NET and outsourced to developers to take care of the back-end, whilst I maintained design, front-end, creative media and project management responsibility</p>
        <p>Due to the volatile nature of the industry, on October 20th 2017, the company went into liquidation and I found myself in the unfortunate position of being made redundant.</p>

      <h2 class="feature__subheader">October 2017 - December 2017</h2>
      <p>Finding myself without a job and in open waters I began to do some research and I realised that over the course of the last few years I had stagnated. I found myself in the undesirable position of feeling adrift in a sea of new technology.
      </p>
      <p>To that end I spent the time between October 20th 2017 and the end of December 2017 researching and adapting to the modern workflow and integrating into my own methodologies.
